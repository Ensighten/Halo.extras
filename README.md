## Getting Started
1. Review the documentation.
2. Select and download the files you want.

## Documentation
### public/js
bodyerror.js - When an `error` event from the DOM hits `document.body`, display an error message. This `error` event is a DOM event like a `click`/`touch`, generated by `validate.js` and such.

microevent.js - Modified microevent to use EventEmitter syntax.

require.js - Modified require.js to use XHR (no longer necessary) and provide custom methods for `config` introspection.

requiredom.js - jQuery plugin that binds event listeners to detect when content is attached to the DOM. This uses a custom Sauron channel, `dom/insert` which is emitted to by `HtmlController`.

tabrow.js - jQuery plugin for handling tabs

validate.js - jQuery plugin for validation handling of fields. It is a low-level interface for validating input. Higher level wrappers, validateField and validateForm (intended for containers) use this API for a higher level interface.

validateField.js - jQuery plugin that listens for `validate` errors (propagating up the DOM) and either renders them to `.validateFieldError` or lets them pass through.

validateForm.js - jQuery plugin that provides methods to check all `validate` inputs and verify they are all passing. Otherwise, error messages are displayed via their respective `validateField`s.
